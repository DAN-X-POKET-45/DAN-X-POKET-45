#### What is the project? Project VOX is->
Project VOX is a decentralized server voxel editing game like minecraft, put and destroy blocks in the ENTIRE WORLD, you can interate with entities, kill or spawn entities too, fight with players or bosses, you also can build mods with PYTHON programing language, but why python? python is easy to learn for peoples like you, without time to learn, python is easy to build scripts and run anywhere.

You can build your own game server (FULL NODE) with your friends or a big comunity, multiplayer is under development, and it's not my concern at the moment.

#### Can I play anywhere?
Not now, because i don't know how to program like a professional developers but, i am working in a XBOX version without the Xbox Live game Servers.

#### Does this game have a story?
Yes! The story is something you must discover for yourself

#### Updates?
Game updates are new mods that the community will make or I will create new blocks, mechanics, textures, characters, items, game optimization, APIs for creating mods, command system, updates to sub-libraries within the project, platforms supported, animations, interaction menus, multiplayer connection system, server officialization, mod instruction manual, sounds, in-game music development methods, companion building and management systems, primitive things, medieval things, current things , futuristic things, planting systems, combat systems and building items, tools and equipment. This big text defines what I can do or what eosmods can do better than me.

#### Do you have a team?
No, definitely not, I'm doing everything myself from completely scratch, in a personal way, I'm not using software development standards because I didn't study this, I'm learning to program and this is my main personal project, if anyone wants contribute, contribute a donation, if someone wants to become part of the team, they need to propose changes (commits)

#### What is the price?
This game is free, BUT WAIT, I NEED TO EAT, DRINK AND PAY MY BILLS, I'm going to create a donation system because I really need a monthly income

#### Is the game open source?
Yes!, but no, the game yes, the engine, map generation core or map loading core will no longer be open source, the engine is my property, it will not be open source because I love this engine that I made myself
